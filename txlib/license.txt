 OK, so the LGPL license is a non-trivial amount of legalese :-)

 In short, what can I do with the supplied TxWin library and its source ?


 Q: Can I make private modifications to TxWin ?

 A: Yes, but ONLY FOR PRIVATE USE. If you distribute your modifications,
    even when embedded in an application, you must make those modifications
    to TxWin available in source form as well.


 Q: Can I use TxWin in my commercial, closed source applications ?

 A: Yes, as long as you acknowledge the use and copyrights of TxWin in your
    documentation and or copyright displays in the product ('about' dialog)
    There is NO REQUIREMENT to publish the source of the application itself.


 Q: Can I use TxWin as the basis for my own commercial library ?

 A: No, a library deriving from TxWin code is bound by the conditions
    of the LGPL and must have it source code made available.
